#Defect Tracking Statuses and Workflow

# Introduction #

In order to optimally manage defect assignments through the life cycle of the defect, we will use the following defect statuses and workflow.


# Defect Status and Descriptions #

## **Open Statuses** ##
**New**  =  Defect identified, documented, & handed off to test lead for review.


**In Process** =  HR has acknowledged receipt of defect & triage has begun.


**Pending** =   Root cause has been identified & fix/resolution is in development.


**Retest**  =  Fix has been verified in QA by HR and delivered to BCBSMA for validation (this value replaces the fixed value used during release 1.0).


## **Closed Statuses** ##


**Closed\_Code Fix** =   Issue required Code Fix to resolve.  Fix validated, issue closed.


**Closed\_Configuration** =   A configuration update was required to resolve.  Fix validated, issue closed.


**Closed\_Duplicate** =   Behavior and/or root cause is a duplicate of an existing Issue.  Issue closed after reference to original issue added to ticket.

**Closed\_Permissions** =   Issue resolved by updating the permissions for a user role.  Fix validated, issue closed.


**Closed\_Training** =    Issues eligible for this closing reason include ‘by design’ functionality that was previously unclear, known system constraints, and unrelated downstream functionality of 3rd party applications.  Resolution of these items follows a job aid documentation process as a project task.


**Closed\_Process** =  Issue was resolved and has been closed (replaces ‘Other’ from 1.0 UAT).
